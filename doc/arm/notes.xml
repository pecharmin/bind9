		With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC is changing the open source
		license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla Public License
		(MPL 2.0).  This change is effective from BIND 9.11.0b1 onwards.
	</para>
	<para>
		The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to licensed
		software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside your organization,
		that you publish those changes under that same license. It does not
		require that you publish or disclose anything other than the changes
		you made to our software.
	</para>
	<para>
		This new requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
		without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without changes,
		therefore this change will be without consequence for most individuals
		and organizations who are using BIND.
	</para>
	<para>
		Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their use of
		BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the license may contact
		ISC at <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/">https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/</link>.

        <para>
	  A new method of provisioning secondary servers called
	  "Catalog Zones" has been added. This is an implementation of
	  <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-muks-dnsop-dns-catalog-zones/">
	    draft-muks-dnsop-dns-catalog-zones/
	  </link>.
        </para>
        <para>
	  A catalog zone is a regular DNS zone which contains a list
	  of "member zones", along with the configuration options for
	  each of those zones.  When a server is configured to use a
	  catalog zone, all the zones listed in the catalog zone are
	  added to the local server as slave zones.  When the catalog
	  zone is updated (e.g., by adding or removing zones, or
	  changing configuration options for existing zones) those
	  changes will be put into effect.  Since the catalog zone is
	  itself a DNS zone, this means configuration changes can be
	  propagated to slaves using the standard AXFR/IXFR update
	  mechanism.
        </para>
        <para>
      This feature should be considered experimental. It currently
	  supports only basic features; more advanced features such as
	  ACLs and TSIG keys are not yet supported. Example catalog
	  zone configurations can be found in the Chapter 9 of the
	  BIND Administrator Reference Manual.
        </para>
		<para>
	  Support for master entries with TSIG keys has been added to catalog
	  zones, as well as support for allow-query and allow-transfer.

	  Added rndc python module.

	<para>
	  Added support for DynDB, a new interface for loading zone data
	  from an external database, developed by Red Hat for the FreeIPA
	  project.  (Thanks in particular to Adam Tkac and Petr
	  Spacek of Red Hat for the contribution.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  Unlike the existing DLZ and SDB interfaces, which provide a
	  limited subset of database functionality within BIND &mdash;
	  translating DNS queries into real-time database lookups with
	  relatively poor performance and with no ability to handle
	  DNSSEC-signed data &mdash; DynDB is able to fully implement
	  and extend the database API used natively by BIND.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A DynDB module could pre-load data from an external data
	  source, then serve it with the same performance and
	  functionality as conventional BIND zones, and with the
	  ability to take advantage of database features not
	  available in BIND, such as multi-master replication.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  New quotas have been added to limit the queries that are
	  sent by recursive resolvers to authoritative servers
	  experiencing denial-of-service attacks. When configured,
	  these options can both reduce the harm done to authoritative
	  servers and also avoid the resource exhaustion that can be
	  experienced by recursives when they are being used as a
	  vehicle for such an attack.
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <option>fetches-per-server</option> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent to any single
	      authoritative server.  The configured value is a starting
	      point; it is automatically adjusted downward if the server is
	      partially or completely non-responsive. The algorithm used to
	      adjust the quota can be configured via the
	      <option>fetch-quota-params</option> option.

	    <para>
	      <option>fetches-per-zone</option> limits the number of

	      value is not self-tuning.)
	    </para>

	  Statistics counters have also been added to track the number

	  Added support for <command>dnstap</command>, a fast,
	  flexible method for capturing and logging DNS traffic,
	  developed by Robert Edmonds at Farsight Security, Inc.,
	  whose assistance is gratefully acknowledged.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To enable <command>dnstap</command> at compile time,

	</para>
	<para>
	  A new utility <command>dnstap-read</command> has been added

	  New statistics counters have been added to track traffic
	  sizes, as specified in RSSAC002.  Query and response
	  message sizes are broken up into ranges of histogram buckets:
	  TCP and UDP queries of size 0-15, 16-31, ..., 272-288, and 288+,
	  and TCP and UDP responses of size 0-15, 16-31, ..., 4080-4095,
	  and 4096+.  These values can be accessed via the XML and JSON
	  statistics channels at, for example,
	  <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://localhost:8888/xml/v3/traffic">http://localhost:8888/xml/v3/traffic</link>

		rcode-volume reporting are now collected.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A new DNSSEC key management utility,
	  <command>dnssec-keymgr</command>, has been added. This tool
	  is meant to run unattended (e.g., under <command>cron</command>).
	  It reads a policy definition file
	  (default: <filename>/etc/dnssec.policy</filename>)
	  and creates or updates DNSSEC keys as necessary to ensure that a
	  zone's keys match the defined policy for that zone.  New keys are
	  created whenever necessary to ensure rollovers occur correctly.
	  Existing keys' timing metadata is adjusted as needed to set the
	  correct rollover period, prepublication interval, etc.  If
	  the configured policy changes, keys are corrected automatically.
	  See the <command>dnssec-keymgr</command> man page for full details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note: <command>dnssec-keymgr</command> depends on Python and on
	  the Python lex/yacc module, PLY. The other Python-based tools,
	  <command>dnssec-coverage</command> and
	  <command>dnssec-checkds</command>, have been
	  refactored and updated as part of this work.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <command>dnssec-keymgr</command> now takes a -r
	  <replacable>randomfile</replacable> option.

	  The serial number of a dynamically updatable zone can
	  now be set using
	  <command>rndc signing -serial <replaceable>number</replaceable> <replaceable>zonename</replaceable></command>.
	  This is particularly useful with <option>inline-signing</option>
	  zones that have been reset.  Setting the serial number to a value
	  larger than that on the slaves will trigger an AXFR-style
	  transfer.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When answering recursive queries, SERVFAIL responses can now be
	  cached by the server for a limited time; subsequent queries for
	  the same query name and type will return another SERVFAIL until
	  the cache times out.  This reduces the frequency of retries
	  when a query is persistently failing, which can be a burden
	  on recursive serviers.  The SERVFAIL cache timeout is controlled
	  by <option>servfail-ttl</option>, which defaults to 1 second
	  and has an upper limit of 30.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The new <command>rndc nta</command> command can now be used to
	  set a "negative trust anchor" (NTA), disabling DNSSEC validation for
	  a specific domain; this can be used when responses from a domain
	  are known to be failing validation due to administrative error
	  rather than because of a spoofing attack. NTAs are strictly
	  temporary; by default they expire after one hour, but can be
	  configured to last up to one week.  The default NTA lifetime
	  can be changed by setting the <option>nta-lifetime</option> in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. When added, NTAs are stored in a
	  file (<filename><replaceable>viewname</replaceable>.nta</filename>)
	  in order to persist across restarts of the <command>named</command> server.

	  The EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option is now supported for
	  authoritative servers; if a query contains an ECS option then
	  ACLs containing <option>geoip</option> or <option>ecs</option>
	  elements can match against the address encoded in the option.
	  This can be used to select a view for a query, so that different
	  answers can be provided depending on the client network.

	  NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
	  from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
	  of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
	  delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
	  of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
	  as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
	  change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
	  "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
	  recommended configuration.)

	  The names of the files used to store managed keys and added
	  zones for each view are no longer based on the SHA256 hash
	  of the view name, except when this is necessary because the
	  view name contains characters that would be incompatible with use
	  as a file name.  For views whose names do not contain forward
	  slashes ('/'), backslashes ('\'), or capital letters - which
	  could potentially cause namespace collision problems on
	  case-insensitive filesystems - files will now be named
	  after the view (for example, <filename>internal.mkeys</filename>
	  or <filename>external.nzf</filename>).  However, to ensure
	  consistent behavior when upgrading, if a file using the old
	  name format is found to exist, it will continue to be used.
